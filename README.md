## Matrix Container Library

This project provides a container class for working with 2D matrices, offering essential algebraic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes basic algorithms for computing matrix properties like the determinant and transpose.

## Future Plans

* Implementing iterators for better traversal and manipulation.
* Optimizing determinant and inverse matrix calculations for large matrices with thousands of elements.
* Adding more advanced algorithms for solving systems of equations.
